JSConstraints is a really small library extending `UIView` and `UIStackView` functionalities

## üì• Installation
JSConstraints is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). 

### Cocoapods
To install via Cocoapods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'JSConstraints'
```
<br>

### Swift Package Manager
Using SPM instead? In Xcode project, select **File** > **Swift Package** > **Add Package Dependecy** and enter the repo URL below.
```
https://github.com/jaysack/JSConstraints
```

## üìì How It Works?

### Import Library
First, import the library
```swift
import JSConstraints
```
- - - -
<br>

### Adding Constraints
```swift
// 1. Add to superview
view.addSubview(pinkSquare)

// 2. Set constraints
pinkSquare.setConstraints([
    .bottom(view.bottomAnchor),
    .leading(view.leadingAnchor) + .constant(18)
])
```
<img src="https://jonathansack.io/swift/framework/jsconstraints/how_it_works/adding_constraints.png" alt="Pink square in Xcode simulator" height="500">
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
1. We constrained `pinkSquare` to our view‚Äôs bottom anchor
```swift
let bottomConstraint = .bottom(view.bottomAnchor)
```
<br>

2. We also constrained `pinkSquare` 18 points away from our view‚Äôs leading anchor
```swift
let leadingConstraint = .leading(view.leadingAnchor) + .constant(18)
```
<br>

#### Refactored Form
Let‚Äôs put it all back together, and we get:
```swift
// Add pink square to superview
view.addSubview(pinkSquare)

// Set constraints
pinkSquare.setConstraints([ bottomConstraint, leadingConstraint ])
```
> üí° `constant` argument is optional and replaced by `0` if not provided

<br>

### Reliative Constraints
```swift
indigoView.relWidth(pinkSquare.widthAnchor) * .multiplier(2)
```
<img src="https://jonathansack.io/swift/framework/jsconstraints/how_it_works/relative_constraints.png" alt="Indigo rectangle in Xcode simulator" height="500">
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We set the width of `indigoView` to be twice ( 2 times) as big as  `pinkSquare` width.
> üí° `multiplier` argument is optional and replaced by `1` if not provided
- - - -
<br>

### Sides
The `.side()` enum allows you to create square views quickly by setting both the view's width and height to the same value.
```swift
pinkSquare.setConstraints([ .sides(165) ])
```

#### What Just Happened?
We set both `width` and `height` constraints to `165`.

<br>

### Centering a View
```swift
yellowCircle.centerIn(superview: self.view)
```
<img src="https://jonathansack.io/swift/framework/jsconstraints/how_it_works/centering_a_view.png" alt="Yellow circle in Xcode simulator" height="500">
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We constrained `yellowCircle` in the **center** of the the screen.

### Pin to Superview
```swift
indigoView.pinTo(superview: self.view, withPadding: 18)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What About `UILayoutGuide` Cases?
Depending on your design, you may opt to pin your view to either your ViewController's `view` or it's `layoutGuide` as both are supported with JSConstraints.\
Using `layoutGuide` will automatically add a child view to the layout guide's owner view:
```swift
indigoView.pinTo(layoutGuide: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide) 

// Indigo view was automatically added to `view` subviews
```
- - - -
<br>


## ‚ôªÔ∏è How About Dynamic Constraints?
JSConstraints methods always return the collection of successfully activated constraints.\
We can use it to toggle between  `active` and `inactive` states.
<br>

### 1. Get Active Constraints
```swift
// Save returned constraints
var dynamicConstraints = yellowCircle.setConstraints([ .bottom(blueRectangle.topAnchor) ])
```
Here, a list of activated constraints of type `[NSLayoutConstraint]` is returned to us. We can save the result in `dynamicConstraints` variable.\
<br>

### 2. Update Constraints
```swift
// Deactivate optional constraints
dynamicConstraints.forEach { $0.isActive = false }

// Set new constraints
yellowCircle.centerIn(superview: self.view)
```
Here, we‚Äôre deactivating our optional constraints, then, adding new constraints
