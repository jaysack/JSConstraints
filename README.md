> üí° A tiny Swift library written with only one thing in mind: **Blazin' Fast Programmatic Constraints-Typing**.

JSConstraints is a really small library extending `UIView` and `UIStackView` functionalities.

## üì• Installation
JSConstraints is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). 

### Cocoapods
To install via Cocoapods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'JSConstraints'
```
<br>

### Swift Package Manager
Using SPM instead? In Xcode project, select **File** > **Swift Package** > **Add Package Dependecy** and paste the URL below.
```
https://github.com/jaysack/JSConstraints
```

## üìì How It Works?
JSConstraints removes all unecessary boilerplate code needed when creating programmatic constraints.\
Simply use one of the methods below to constraint any view:
- `setConstraints()`
- `centerIn()`
- `pintTo()`
```swift
// Default
foo.setConstraints([ .top(view.topAnchor) ])

// Shortcut
foo.üîó([ .top(view.topAnchor) ])

```


### Import Library
First, import the library
```swift
import JSConstraints
```
- - - -
<br>

### Square
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/square-example.png" alt="Pink square in Xcode simulator">

The `.square()` enum is pretty straight forward and allows you to make "squared" view. It sets both, width and height, to the value provided.
```swift
pinkSquare.setConstraints([ .square(185) ])
```

#### What Just Happened?
We set both `width` and `height` constraints to `185`.

### Directional Constraints
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/directional-constraints-example.png" alt="Pink constraints to left and bottom in Xcode simulator">

```swift
// 1. Add to superview
view.addSubview(pinkSquare)

// 2. Set constraints
pinkSquare.setConstraints([
    .leading(view.leadingAnchor),
    .bottom(view.bottomAnchor) + .constant(18)
])
```
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
1. We constrained `pinkSquare` to its superview's leading anchor.
```swift
let leadingConstraint = .leading(view.leadingAnchor)
```
<br>

2. We then constrained  `pinkSquare` again 18 points aways from its superview bottom anchor.
```swift
let bottomConstraint = .bottom(view.bottomAnchor) + .constant(18)
```
<br>


#### Refactored Form
Let‚Äôs put it all back together, and we get:
```swift
// Add pink square to superview
view.addSubview(pinkSquare)

// Set constraints
pinkSquare.üîó([ bottomConstraint, leadingConstraint ])
```
> üí° `constant` argument is optional and replaced by 0 if not provided.

### Reliative Constraints
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/relative-constraints-example.png" alt="Pink constraints to left and bottom in Xcode simulator">

```swift
indigoView.setConstraints([
    .relWidth(view.widthAnchor) * .multiplier(0.4),
    .relHeight(pinkSquare.heightAnchor) * .multiplier(1.18)
])

// We're assuming here that the indigo view's in already in
// its superview's stack and has been constrained from its top and right sides.
```
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We set the width of `indigoView` to be 0.4 times the size of  `view` width.\
We also set `indigoView` to be slightly taller than our `pinkSquare`.

> üí° `multiplier` argument is optional and replaced by 1 if not provided.

### Centering a View
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/centering-view-example.png" alt="Yellow circle in Xcode simulator">

```swift
yellowCircle.centerIn(superview: self.view)
```
<br>

#### What Just Happened?
We constrained `yellowCircle` in the **center** of the the screen.

### Pin to Superview
<img src="https://jaysack-github-readme.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/jsconstraints/pin-to-superview-example.png" alt="Indigo view pinned to superview in Xcode simulator">

```swift
indigoView.pinTo(superview: self.view, withPadding: 18)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What About `UILayoutGuide` Cases?
Depending on your design, you may opt to pin your view to either your ViewController's `view` or it's `layoutGuide` as both are supported with JSConstraints.\
Using `layoutGuide` will automatically add a child view to the layout guide's owner view:
```swift
indigoView.pinTo(layoutGuide: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide) 

// Indigo view was automatically added to `view` subviews
```
- - - -
<br>


## ‚ôªÔ∏è How About Dynamic Constraints?
JSConstraints methods always return the collection of successfully activated constraints.\
We can use it to toggle between  `active` and `inactive` states.
<br>

### 1. Get Active Constraints
```swift
// Save returned constraints
var pinkOptionalConstraints = pinkSquare.setConstraints([ bottomConstraint, leadingConstraint ])
var indigoOptionalConstraints = indigoView.setConstraints([ topConstraint, trailingConstraint ])

// Append to array of dynamic constraints
dynamicConstraints.append(contentsOf: pinkOptionalConstraints)
dynamicConstraints.append(contentsOf: indigoOptionalConstraints)
```
Here, a list of activated constraints of type `[NSLayoutConstraint]` is returned to us. We can save the result in `dynamicConstraints` variable.\
<br>

### 2. Update Constraints
```swift
// Deactivate optional constraints
dynamicConstraints.forEach { $0.isActive = false }

// Set new constraints
[pinkSquare, indigoView].forEach { $0.centerIn(superview: view) }
```
Here, we‚Äôre deactivating our optional constraints, then, adding new constraints.
